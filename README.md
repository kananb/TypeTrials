## Description
### About
Type Trials is a typing trainer built in Java that generates sentences based on a [bigram language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram).

### The problem
When it comes to typable content used in a typing trainer there are two options:
1. static selection of curated texts
2. procedurally generated sentences

#### Static content
Although simple and easy to implement, choosing to use a pre-determined selection of text comes with some drawbacks. Namely, using static content requires having many samples of text in order to reduce the amount of repetition a user encounters while typing. If a user sees the same section of text multiple times throughout their training they may begin to memorize it, making it easier to type and artificially improving their score. To mitigate this, we can use procedurally generated sentences to achieve a much wider range of unique typable content than with static text samples alone.

#### Generated content
A trivial approach to procedurally generated sentences is to use a big dictionary and randomly select words from it to build a sentence. The problem with this though is that these types of sentences are very difficult and unrealistic to type since normal sentences follow particular patterns and structures not present in a sequence of random words.

So, to accomodate this problem, we can use a [bigram language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram) to generate the sentences. A bigram maps each of the words in a text sample to every word that may come after it. For example, the text `"The fox jumped over the lazy dog"` generates the following bigram:
```
{
  "the": ["fox", "lazy"],
  "fox": ["jumped"],
  "jumped": ["over"],
  "over": ["the"],
  "lazy": ["dog"],
  "dog": []
}
```
With this information a sentence can be generated by choosing a starting word and randomly picking one of the words it maps to as the next word. By generating our bigram over a large section of text, we can allow for a huge range of possible sentences that all feel natural to type.
